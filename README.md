# FG-Liveries
A collection of liveries for FlightGear that I've made over some time.

This repository contains several aircraft liveries designed for various aircraft in FlightGear Flight Simulator. It includes liveries for the following aircraft:
  - Airbus A350XWB (https://github.com/merspieler/A350-family)
  - 747-400, passenger and cargo (https://github.com/LincolnWorks-FlightGear/747-400)
  - 787 (8, 9, 10 - https://github.com/IskenderWang/787-family)
  - A320 family (see below)
  - 767-300 (https://github.com/dogsaysmoo/767-300)
  
 Note:
 Unfortunately, the aircraft file that the A320 liveries were designed for only functions correctly for versions 2017 and older. If you attempt to fly it in any 2018 or 2019 versions, the aircraft will not take off, and if you try to fly it in any versions newer than that it will not load.
 Here is the link to the broken aircraft:

 More liveries are underway! If you have any questions, email me at sriemmanuel787@outlook.com
